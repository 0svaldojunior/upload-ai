# NLW AI Week with Next.js 13

Welcome to the NLW AI Week with Next.js 13, a project inspired by the original work of Diego Fernandes, CTO of Rocketseat. We've made some modifications to integrate with Next.js version 13, including the use of server components and leveraging React's context API for seamless variable communication between components.

## Getting Started

### Web Application

To set up the web application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `web` directory in your terminal.
2. Install the dependencies using the following command: pnpm i
3. Start the development server with: pnpm run dev

### API Server

For the API server, follow these instructions:

1. Go to the `api` directory in your terminal.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using: pnpm i
3. Start the API server with: pnpm run dev
4. You can explore your database by running: pnpm prisma studio

## Overview

This project aims to showcase the power of Next.js version 13, incorporating server components for efficient rendering and utilizing React's context API to facilitate variable communication across components.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to this exciting journey into the world of AI and web development.
